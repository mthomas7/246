Here is a short tutorial on dplyr. Because this source is hosted on github, you can download the source Rmd file, and suggest revisions directly.

We first need to load the `dplyr` package. Make sure it is installed (it should be listed in your packages), then check the box next to it. If you are writing a script which will use dplyr, you can incluce

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
```

or

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
require(dplyr)
```

(What is the difference between the two?)
