## Why do we need this?

Load the hypothetical gre data from ucla dataset, and explore the data (summary).

Say we want to predict whether someone is admitted to grad school... what could we do?

Q: What percent of the students were admitted to grad school?

## What kind of function (board work)

## Doing logistic regression with the grad school dataset

The `lm` command did linear regression, the `glm` command is the generalized linear model.

Format:

`model <- glm(y ~ x, data = mydata, family = "binomial")`

Why binomial?

## A Null model

Get a summary of a logistic regression predicting admit with no predictors

## New variable

Make a new column called `prestige` which is 1 if the school has rank 1 or 2, and 0 if it has rank 3 or 4.

Make a new logistic model predicting admit using `prestige`.
